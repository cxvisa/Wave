# ISLE

The ISLE project shwocases hwo to build an application usong Wave Framework.
The project currently show cases C++ example.
It includes how to create services, managed objects and persistence, built in self test and a debug shell at the minimum.

## C++

### How to use

Copy the entire source tree into a directory parallel to that of Wave parent diretory.
Let us say Wave is under the foillowing tree:

$HOME/CxWave/Wave

The copy the ISLE directory tree into something like the following:

$HOME/MyProject/Isle

You can build $HOME/MyProject/Isle/C++/source and $HOME/MyProject/Isle/C++/application
directories right away assuming that you could successfully build Wave already.

The Library generated for the porject will be on the lines of libIsle.so and the
application binary generated will be "Island".  Replace Isle and and Island in the
file names and code base as suited to your needs.

Happy Coding!
